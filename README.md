# 🛍️ Hanuvan Website Contribution - Payment Gateway Integration 🚀
## 📌 Overview
I had the opportunity to contribute to the **Hanuvan** website by implementing a seamless **payment gateway** using **Razorpay Test Mode** in **React.js**. This feature enhances the user experience by enabling secure transactions and ensuring a smooth checkout process. Additionally, I worked on core e-commerce functionalities such as **shopping, continuing shopping, and viewing the cart**. 🛒💳

## 💻 Tech Stack Used
- **Frontend:** React.js ⚛️, JavaScript ES6+ 
- **State Management:** React Hooks (useState, useEffect) 🔄
- **Payment Integration:** Razorpay API 💳
- **UI Library:** Tailwind CSS 🎨
- **Routing:** React Router v6 

## 🔑 Key Features Implemented
### 1️⃣ Razorpay Payment Gateway Integration 💸
- Integrated **Razorpay Test Mode** for a seamless checkout experience.
- Dynamically generated **order IDs** and processed payments securely.
- Handled successful transactions and failures with **real-time status updates**.

### 2️⃣ Shopping & Cart Management 🛍️
- Implemented **Add to Cart** functionality with smooth state management.
- Enabled users to **continue shopping** while maintaining cart items.
- Developed an intuitive **View Cart** page displaying all selected products.

## 🚀 How It Works
1️⃣ User adds products to the cart 🛒  
2️⃣ Proceeds to checkout and selects payment mode 💳  
3️⃣ Razorpay **test mode** processes the transaction 🔄  
4️⃣ Displays payment success/failure message ✅❌  
5️⃣ Order details are updated in the system 📦

## ⚡ Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh

3. Start the development server:

4. Update **Razorpay API Key** in the `.env` file:

   ```

## 🛠️ Challenges & Learnings
- **Handling asynchronous payments** and ensuring smooth UI updates.
- **Managing state efficiently** when users navigate between shopping and checkout.
- **Ensuring security** in API requests while interacting with Razorpay.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
